This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, cache = TRUE}
url <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
download.file(url, "pml-training.csv")
data <- read.csv("./pml-training.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
